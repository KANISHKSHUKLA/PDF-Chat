# PDF Chat

A Streamlit-based web application that allows users to chat with PDF documents. This project utilizes **Langchain**, **Streamlit**, and various AI models to convert PDF documents into conversational knowledge bases. Users can ask questions about the contents of the uploaded PDFs and receive responses in real-time.

## Features

- Upload and process multiple PDF files
- Extract text from PDF and chunk it for efficient querying
- Use AI models for semantic search and conversational Q&A
- Conversational history tracking for a seamless experience

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Langchain**: For handling embeddings, vector storage, and conversational chains.
- **PyPDF2**: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
- **OpenAI** or **VertexAI**: For embeddings and language models.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search on text embeddings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-chat.git
   cd pdf-chat
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding the following (replace with your actual keys or credentials):
   ```text
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

## Running the App

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8502` to start using the PDF Chat app.

## How It Works

### 1. **PDF Upload**
   Users can upload multiple PDF files through the file uploader in the sidebar. The app will extract text from these PDFs.

### 2. **Text Chunking**
   The extracted text is split into chunks for more efficient querying. Each chunk will be indexed and stored in a FAISS vector store.

### 3. **Embedding & Vector Store**
   The text chunks are converted into embeddings using **OpenAI's** or **VertexAI's** embedding models. These embeddings are stored in the FAISS vector store for fast retrieval during the conversation.

### 4. **Conversational AI**
   Once the PDF text is processed, users can interact with the chatbot by typing questions in the input field. The app uses a **ConversationalRetrievalChain** to provide relevant answers based on the document's content.

### 5. **Chat History**
   The conversation is stored in memory, allowing users to see their previous questions and the botâ€™s responses, creating a natural, continuous chat experience.

## Environment Variables

The app uses the following environment variables:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (required if using OpenAI embeddings).
- **HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY**: Your Hugging Face API key (if using Hugging Face models).

Make sure to add these keys in the `.env` file.

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the command below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

```text
streamlit==x.x.x
PyPDF2==x.x.x
langchain==x.x.x
openai==x.x.x
faiss-cpu==x.x.x
huggingface_hub==x.x.x
python-dotenv==x.x.x
langchain-google-vertexai==x.x.x
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues related to protobuf versions or any other dependencies, try the following:

1. Downgrade `protobuf` to version `3.20.x`:
   ```bash
   pip install protobuf==3.20.3
   ```

2. Alternatively, set the environment variable `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION` to `python` for a slower but compatible protobuf parser:
   ```bash
   set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
   ```
